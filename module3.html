		<h2 id="chicken-heading"> Chicken</h2>
		<p id="chicken-para">Chickens have a squat and rounded appearance. They stand less than 70 cm (27.6 inches) tall and weigh approximately 2.6 kg (5.7 pounds) on average. Males (called cocks or roosters) and females (hens) are known for their fleshy combs, lobed wattles hanging below the bill, and high-arched tails. In some roosters, the tail can extend more than 30 cm (12 inches) in length.</p>

	<div class="container" id="mutton-box">
		<h2 id="mutton-heading"> Mutton </h2>
		<p id="mutton-para">Mutton is vigorously rich in iron and zinc. Iron is primarily utilized in the body in the formation of blood cells and blood. This is one reason why people with iron deficiencies are advised to eat red meat, especially mutton. Mutton is meat from a sheep that is older than 1 year, ideally 3 years old. It is an intense red color and contains a considerable amount of fat. Its flavor is very strong, and you might have to acquire the taste before being able to enjoy a meal of mutton if you're an American.</p>

		<h2 id="beef-heading">Beef</h2>
		<p id="beef-para">beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.</p>
